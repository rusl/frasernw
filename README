== Welcome to Fraser NW

Some tips for running specs and development:

* use guard! it's great for running specs and livereload

* install livereload in chrome, it's super. Run guard and then hit the LR button in the toolbar and the browser will update with any file you save. It's a 20% boost in productivity.

* All testing is done in rspec. Cucumber hasn't been implemented but the client likes the idea a lot.

* haml where possible

* basic scaffolding has been created with nifty-scaffold

* basic authentication has been implemented with authlogic and nifty-authentication

* file uploads will be done with carrierwave but it hasn't been implemented yet
